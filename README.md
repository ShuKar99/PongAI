# PongAI
Implemented AI for both paddles in classic Atari Pong using lua and LOVE2D. Done as part of GD50 course.

To run this, install lua 5.4.0 from https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/readme.html and LOVE2D 10.2 from https://davcri.github.io/posts/cs50-install-love2d-on-linux/.
This code is freely distributed and can be used as a base for further developement and understanding of the LOVE2D game engine and lua.
